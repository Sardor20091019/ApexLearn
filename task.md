# Backend Technical Task: Udemy Clone

## Overview

Build a fully functional **online course platform** (Udemy clone) backend using **NestJS**. The platform allows instructors to create and manage courses with video content, students to enroll and track their progress, and admins to manage the platform. The system includes real-time chat support, video streaming, background job processing, and caching.

## Database

Design the database schema using Prisma ORM with the following models. All IDs should be UUIDs. Use soft deletes (`deletedAt`) where appropriate.

**Models:** User, Course, Section, Lesson, Category, Enrollment, Review, RefreshToken, Star, Comment, Progress, Upload, Notification, Conversation, Message

**Key relationships:**
- User has roles: `USER` (default), `INSTRUCTOR`, `ADMIN`
- Course belongs to User (author) and Category
- Course has many Sections, each Section has many Lessons
- User can enroll in courses (unique per user+course)
- User can review courses (rating + comment)
- User can star/favorite courses
- User can comment on lessons
- Progress tracks lesson completion per user
- Conversations are between User and Admin with Messages
- RefreshToken stores hashed JWT refresh tokens per user
- Upload tracks media files (VIDEO, IMAGE, DOCUMENT)
- Notification stores user notifications (title, body, isRead)

Design proper indexes, unique constraints, and foreign key relationships based on the features below.

## Guards, Interceptors & Cross-cutting Concerns

### JWT Guard
- Extend `AuthGuard('jwt')` from Passport
- Apply to all protected routes

### Roles Guard
- Read `@Roles()` decorator metadata, compare against `request.user.role`
- Return `ForbiddenException` if role doesn't match

### Roles Decorator
- Custom decorator using `SetMetadata` to define required roles
- Roles enum: `USER`, `INSTRUCTOR`, `ADMIN`

### Logger Interceptor (Global)
- Log every request: timestamp, HTTP method, URL, headers, body, query params
- Log every response: status code, duration (ms), response body
- Log errors: status code, duration, error message
- Generate unique `requestId` (UUID) for request tracing

### Verify User Interceptor
- Extract from request headers: IP address, User-Agent, device ID
- Attach device info to request for downstream processing

### Global Validation Pipe
- Enable `class-validator` globally via `ValidationPipe`
- Auto-transform payloads to DTO instances

---

## Infrastructure

### Docker Compose

Set up the following services:
- **app** — NestJS application (Node 20 Alpine, port 4000)
- **postgres** — PostgreSQL 14 with persistent volume
- **minio** — MinIO S3-compatible storage (ports 9000 API, 9001 console) with persistent volume
- **redis** — Redis 7 (port 6379)

Use named volumes for data persistence and an overlay network for service communication.

### Dockerfile

- Multi-stage build using `node:20-alpine`
- Builder stage: install deps, generate Prisma client, build app
- Runner stage: copy artifacts, run migrations on startup, start server

### Environment Variables

```
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/udemy?schema=public
JWT_AT_SECRET=<access-token-secret>
JWT_RT_SECRET=<refresh-token-secret>
MINIO_USER=<minio-access-key>
MINIO_PASS=<minio-secret-key>
MINIO_PORT=9000
MINIO_URL=http://localhost:9000
MINIO_BUCKET_VIDEO=videos
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Application Bootstrap

- Listen on port `4000`
- Global prefix: `/api/v1`
- Enable CORS
- Body parser limit: `5MB`
- Apply global `ValidationPipe` and `LoggerInterceptor`
- Enable shutdown hooks

### MinIO / S3 Client Service

Implement a reusable MinIO service with methods:
- `uploadFile(bucket, file)` — Upload a single file
- `getFileUrl(bucket, objectName)` — Generate a presigned URL
- `deleteFile(bucket, objectName)` — Delete a file

### Prisma Setup

- Global `PrismaModule` with `PrismaService` extending `PrismaClient`
- Connect on module init, disconnect on destroy
- Use `DATABASE_URL` from environment
